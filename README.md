# Code Challenge for Sr. Fullstack Engineer

## Code Challenge

### Task: Build a Simple RESTful API with Node.js and Express

You are required to create a simple RESTful API using Node.js and Express that manages a list of books. The API should support the following operations:

1.  **GET /books**: Retrieve a list of all books.
2.  **POST /books**: Add a new book to the list. The request body should contain the title and author of the book.
3.  **GET /books/:id**: Retrieve a specific book by its ID.
4.  **PUT /books/:id**: Update the details of a specific book by its ID.
5.  **DELETE /books/:id**: Remove a specific book by its ID.

### Requirements:

*   Use Node.js and Express for the server.
*   Store the books in memory (no need for a database).
*   Validate the input data for creating and updating books.
*   Return appropriate HTTP status codes for each operation.

### Constraints:

*   You have 30 minutes to complete this challenge.
*   You can use any libraries you find necessary, but keep it simple.
